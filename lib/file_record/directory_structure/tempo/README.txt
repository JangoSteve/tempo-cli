Tempo is a command line time tracking application for creating time sheets based on a project hierarchy.


All records will be stored in the tempo folder in the users home directory.  Records are stored in yaml, and can be edited by hand, with discretion.  Be aware that editing by hand could create unresolvable conflicts, especially when it comes to the ids assigned to projects.
